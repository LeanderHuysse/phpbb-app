phpBB 2.0 RC-1 (pre) release : 29th November 2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the final release of phpBB 2.0 before a Release Candidate series (it is beyond beta but not quite RC!). This version uses a database schema (layout) that has now been frozen, in other words an install or upgrade using this release will be database compatible with all future releases of 2.0 (including the soon to follow RC-1).


Running phpBB 2.0 RC-1 (pre)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The install system should be fully operational. Upgrading from previous (1.4.x) versions of phpBB is not yet complete. If you do use it PLEASE backup your current database first! We recommend only 'advanced' users utilise upgrade at this time in case of any problems (which may well require manual fixing of the database).


PHP compatibility issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please remember that running any application on a developmental version of PHP can lead to strange/unexpected results which may appear to be bugs in the application (which may not be true). Therefore we recommend you upgrade to the newest stable version of PHP before running phpBB 2.0 (the most recent stable release of PHP is 4.0.6). If you are running a developmental version of PHP please check any bugs you find on a system running a stable release before submitting.
