phpBB 2.0 RC-1 release : 24th December 2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first full Release Candidate version of phpBB 2.0, the number of RC releases will depend on how quickly we squish bugs. Our intention is to release one version a week as significant numbers of bugs are fixed. ABSOLUTELY NO NEW FEATURES WILL BE ADDED TO THE CORE phpBB 2.0 APPLICATION FROM THIS POINT SO DON'T ASK! (a feature request list for 2.2 will be opened in due course)

Visit the phpBB 2.0 test board at :

http://phpbb.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/


Running phpBB 2.0 RC-1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The install and upgrade scripts should be fully functional. As always we suggest you backup your old phpBB database files before carrying out an upgrade. NOTE TO RC-1 (pre) USERS: You MUST run the update_to_RC1.php script BEFORE attempting to access your board, failing to do so will result in errors. While these won't do any damage they will prevent you using your board. 

In addition users of RC-1 (pre) or users of old CVS versions should change the modify topic_moved_id in the _topics table from NULL to NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' (if required). If you do not do this then topic read tracking may appear to work incorrectly. 

Other minor DB changes have occured and you should examine the schemas to see if your installation requires any modifications (note that most of these have already been discussed on the phpBB2 forums). If you are uncomfortable doing any of this we recommend you re-install (you may backup your existing data if you wish, re-install phpBB2 and then insert your backup).


PHP compatibility issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please remember that running any application on a developmental version of PHP can lead to strange/unexpected results which may appear to be bugs in the application (which may not be true). Therefore we recommend you upgrade to the newest stable version of PHP before running phpBB 2.0 (the most recent stable release of PHP is 4.1.0). If you are running a developmental version of PHP please check any bugs you find on a system running a stable release before submitting.

This board has been developed and tested under Linux and Windows (amongst others) running IIS and Apache using MySQL 3.23 and 4.0.0, MSSQL Server 2000, MS Access 2000 and XP and PostgreSQL 7.0.x and 7.1.x.
