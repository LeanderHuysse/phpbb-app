Some basic configuration instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phpBB 2.0 features a fairly intuitive configuration interface however there are some issues that may cause you to scratch your head, this mini-FAQ should address most of these!


* How do I use the avatar settings?

There are three types of avatar; upload, remote and local. Upload types require you to create a directory (the default is images/avatars) and to set this to public read/write (ie. chmod a+rw), users can then upload avatars (subject to width, height and size limits definable by you). Remote avatars allow the user to supply a URI pointing to an image available on the internet, PLEASE NOTE that size limits do not apply to remote avatars! Local avatars allow you to upload your own avatars to a set directory, users can then pick from this avatar gallery. The default location for this is images/avatars/gallery. PLEASE NOTE that avatars are categorised according to sub-folders in this location! ie. you MUST place your avatars in subdirectories, eg. images/avatars/gallery/cartoons, images/avatars/gallery/real-life, etc.


* How do I set forum permissions

You set forum permissions from the administration control panel->Forums->Permissions. This system has two modes of operation; Simple and Advanced. Simple uses a set of pre-defined authorisation levels, these set each type of authorisation setting to a specific level. Advanced settings allow you to specify individual levels for each operation in each forum. Experiment!


* How do I set user and group permissions

These are set from Admin->Users (Groups)->Permissions. The system may appear strange but it's very powerful. When you look up a user or group it will give you basic information (at the top of the page) followed by the available forum listing and current settings for this user. You can assign moderator status to users and groups and if you have PRIVATE forums (or forums with any of their individual operations set to PRIVATE) you can also assign access.


* How do I set a user (group) as moderator?

See above


* Why are there no entries in the user (group) permission "Allow Access" column?

You can only allow (or deny) users access to PRIVATE forums, or forums which have one or more operations set to PRIVATE


* My users are complaining about being logged out too quickly!

You can increase the default length of sessions (ie. how long before a users session is considered 'dead') in Admin->General->Configuration->Cookie Settings->Session Length. Set it to whatever value your users feel comfortable with, remember that security issues may affect your decision (ie. having too long a session may allow non-users to abuse your board should a user forget to logout or otherwise leave a current session on a public workstation).


* Why are their so many entries under Guests?

If your users are behind a proxy that switches IP's quickly without forwarding them you may find lots of entries like this. Don't worry about it too much.


* My question isn't answered here!

Feel free to search our test boards for the information you require. PLEASE DO NOT post your question without having first used search, chances are someone has already asked and answered your question. You can find our board here:
